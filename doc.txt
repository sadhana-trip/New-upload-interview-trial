Hello grove ,

I have analysed all your code and almost worked properly to do the tasks that you assigned me ,
firstly it was giving column and table error so fixed it then I have worked on popup design for 
scroll and border and then when I was hitting yes then it was giving issue so I elaborate it 
again and seen the connections from web to bll and dal and I got to know that the corresponding
stored procedure is missing and name of procedure is "UDP_BulkInstallUser" but I have handled 
it with a message popup of null value . But without the related procedure I can not see and 
resolve it perfectly.


Thanks
